Introduced a new `asyncapi generate client` command to the CLI.  

This command allows you to generate client libraries using the new **AsyncAPI Generator** baked-in templates. Read more about [baked-in templates in official documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/generator/baked-in-templates).

This feature is based on a new concept introduced in [AsyncAPI Generator version 2.8](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/releases/tag/%40asyncapi%2Fgenerator%402.8.0). The number of templates is limited and solution is still in experimental phase. It is not recommended to use them in production. Instead join us the Generator project to help to improve them with your use cases and your AsyncAPI documents.
