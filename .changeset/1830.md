Introduced a new `asyncapi generate client` command to the CLI.

This command allows you to generate client libraries using the new **AsyncAPI Generator** baked-in templates. Read more about [baked-in templates in official documentation](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/tools/generator/baked-in-templates).

This feature is based on a new concept introduced in [AsyncAPI Generator version 2.8.3](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/releases/tag/%40asyncapi%2Fgenerator%402.8.3). The number of templates is limited and the solution is still in the experimental phase. It is not recommended to use them in production. Instead, join us in the [Generator project](https://github.com/asyncapi/generator) to help improve templates with your use cases and your AsyncAPI documents.
