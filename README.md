## Requirements
To run `@asyncapi/cli`, you'll need Node.js >=v10

Run this terminal command to check your Node.js version:
```
node -v
```

If you don't have Node.js installed or NPM, simply [install both via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

### Installation

Run this command to install the CLI globally on your system:

```
npm install -g @asyncapi/cli
```

This installs the cli globaly on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere. If you want to install it locally, just remove the `-g` flag. 

> Cli will be available for installation brew and other app managers for other systems. 



## Usage

As of now, the `@asyncapi/cli` only supports validation of the specification file. (This is still under development for more features.)

We have well-documented help commands so just run:

```
asyncapi --help 
```




## API Reference

### `validate`

**USAGE**

```
asyncapi validate <spcPath | context-name> [options]
```

If you already have your current context set, run the following command:

```
asyncapi validate
```

**OPTIONS** 

```
-h, --help Display help for command
-w, --watch Enable watch mode (not implemented yet)
```


### `context`

**Context** makes it easier for you to work with multiple AsyncAPI Files. You can add multiple different files to a context so that you don't have to pass the file as an input every time you use any command. You can also set a default context so that you don't have to pass in either file paths or context names as an input.

**USAGE**

```
asyncapi context [options] [command]
```

**COMMANDS**

|command|arguments|description|example|
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
|`list`|`none` |lists all saved context|`asyncapi context list`|
|`current`|`none`|set current context|`asyncapi context current`|
|`use` | `<context-name>`| set any context from the list as current|`asyncapi context use test`|
|`add`|`<context-name> <spec-file-path>`|add/update a context|`asyncapi context add root ./asyncapi.yml`|
|`remove`|`<context-name>`|remove a context from the list|`asyncapi context remove root`|

**OPTIONS**

```
-h, --help display help for command
```



## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/asyncapi/CLI/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

### Set up development enviornment

Follow these steps:
- Clone the repo.
- Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies
- Run `npm run test` to make sure everything is properly set up.

UX developed for the CLI should be compliant with [Command Line Interface Guideline](https://clig.dev/)

### Command Structure and Patterns

We are following `verb + noun` and `namespace + noun + [verb]` pattern for making our commands and arguments. For example `asyncapi validate <spec-file-path>` and `asyncapi config context add <context-name> <spec-file-path>`.
