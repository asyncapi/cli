<!-- /TOC -->

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the AsyncAPI open project, which has been established as AsyncAPI Project a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”).  LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All Contributors (including Committers and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter.

### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

1. The mission of the Project is to provide open-source vendor-neutral specification(s) and tools to facilitate the development and governance of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
2. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration, and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation, or adoption of the open-source project.
3. The vision and strategy of the Project will be defined in the ROADMAP view within the Project’s website.

### 2. Technical Steering Committee

1. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for the oversight of the open-source Project.  
2. From the inception of the Project to March 31, 2022 (or such other date as determined by the TSC, such period of time the “Startup Period”), the members of the TSC will be those individuals named as the initial TSC members on the Project’s code repository.  The TSC may appoint an Executive Director (“ED”) to be responsible during the Startup Period for the overall architectural vision of the Project.  The ED also has to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.  The name of the ED will be specified in the GOVERNANCE file in the Project’s code repository.  The role of the ED will disappear after the conclusion of the Startup Period.
3. Following the conclusion of the Startup Period, composition of the TSC will be determined through an open mechanism to be set by the TSC (and described on the Project’s code repository).
4. TSC membership is not time-limited. There’s no maximum size of TSC. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. Following the Startup Period, the TSC must have at least three members.
5. No more than one-fourth of the TSC members may be affiliated with the same employer. If the removal or resignation of a TSC member, or a change of employment/affiliation by a TSC member, creates a situation where more than one-fourth of the TSC membership shares an employer, then the situation must be assessed by TSC. In any case, the number of TSC members affiliated with the same employer must not be higher than one-third (round half up number).
6. Committers are the voting members of the TSC and must be listed in the VOTERS file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the Project’s GOVERNANCE file.
7. TSC members may resign from their right to vote and ask to be removed from the VOTERS file within the Project’s code repository.
8. Any meetings of the TSC are intended to be open to the public, recorded, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.
9. TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the Project’s GOVERNANCE file.
10. TSC members are expected to regularly participate in TSC voting.
11. In the case where an individual TSC member -- within any three-month period -- does not participate in TSC votes, the member shall be automatically removed from the TSC.
12. A TSC member may be removed from the TSC by the majority approval of the other TSC members.
13. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC. In the case of replacement, TSC voting must follow the approach described in Section 4.
14. The TSC may decide to change the Project’s vision and strategy. In that case, TSC voting must follow the approach described in Section 4.
15. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.
16. Responsibilities: The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:
    1. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;
    2. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);
    3. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;
    4. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;
    5. appointing representatives to work with other open-source or open standards communities;
    6. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;
    7. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 6 of this Charter;
    8. directing the allocation of community donations on crowdfunding platforms;
    9. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and
    10. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.

### 3. Committers and Contributors

1. Contributors include anyone in the community that contributes code, documentation, pull request reviews, or other technical artifacts to the Project (“Contributors”); 
2. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository (“Committers”);
3. A Contributor may become a Committer of a given Project’s repository by majority approval of the repository Committers.
4. A Committer must be listed in the CODEOWNERS file of a given Project’s repository, along with the scope of their responsibility in the repository.
5. A Committer may be removed from a Project’s repository by the majority approval of the other Committers of the same repository.
6. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. 

### 4. TSC Voting

1. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.
2. Quorum is not needed to make a decision.
3. Except as provided in Section 5, decisions require a majority of votes.
4. Decisions must be always made offline, by electronic vote.
5. The voting process is described in the GOVERNANCE. In any case, TSC members must have no more and no less than 7 calendar days to vote.

### 5. Amendments

1. This charter may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire TSC and is subject to approval by LF Projects.
2. A quorum of two-thirds is needed to amend this charter. If after two amendment attempts, the quorum is not reached then a last amendment attempt will be conducted without the need for quorum and only two-thirds of the votes will be needed.
