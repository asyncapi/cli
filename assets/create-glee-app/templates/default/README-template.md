This is a [Glee](https://github.com/asyncapi/glee) project bootstrapped with the [AsyncAPI CLI](https://github.com/asyncapi/cli).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the API by modifying `functions/onHello.js` and `asyncapi.yaml`. The server auto-updates as you edit the file.
